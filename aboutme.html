            <p>Hi! I'm Shola and my name means <i>Sunshine</i> and <i>Moonlight</i> in Kyrgyz Language.
                Yeap, my native language is Kyrgyz language and I'm originaly from Kyrgyzstan. I moved to Turkey to
                study ancient Turkic Languages at the Istanbul University.
                I love learning about different cultures and their unique cuisine. When I used to live in Turkey -
                my favorite Turkish food was Adana Kebab and Turkish breakfast.
                Nowadays, I feel extremely happy because I have an authentic cuisine from all around the world to
                try and eat.
                Beside, trying and eating diffent foods I do have other interest too hahah.
                I love workout, travelling, reading and dancing. I enjoy of my daily walks around the neighborhood
                with a cup of hot Americano. </p>
